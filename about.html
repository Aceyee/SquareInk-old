            <h2>About Zihan</h2>
            <p>
                A 'Sporty Geek' who loves exercising and coding, especially
                for android app, website development, and mahine learning.
            </p>

            <h2>My Opinion</h2>
            <p>
                On my own view, I think highly of the industry of gaming abd gaminology,
                especially, when we apply gaminology to education.<br>
                <br>
                People are addicted to games: They are born with the nature of gaming;
                they can learn while they are playing games; they can engage themselves
                when they win.If we put effort on merging educational information
                (e.g. history event) into a game, players can definitely obtain the
                information. Plus current graphics are so amazing that they can leave
                an impressive strike on players' brains. Then as a game developing,
                the industry of deep learning and AI can also get deeply influenced.
